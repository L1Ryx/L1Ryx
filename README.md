## üëã Hello there!
I'm Shawn Guo, a gameplay programmer and technical sound designer at [Serious Point Games](https://www.seriouspointgames.com/). At the moment, I‚Äôm working on our upcoming PC/VR title, *The Ski Lodge Murder*. 

I also co-founded the [Hopkins Game Dev Society](https://www.hopkinsgamedevsociety.com/), where we empower Johns Hopkins University students to create games by providing formal mentorship and hosting career-building events.

I'm comfortable with:
- Game Engines: Unity, Unreal
- Languages: C++, C#, C, Javascript (React, TypeScript), Java, GLSL, HLSL, Python
- Audio Middleware: Wwise, FMOD

When I‚Äôm not working on professional projects, I like building personal games and implementing cool game design ideas (glorified shower thoughts). This page serves as a brief introduction to my work and a showcase of some of the more recent personal projects I‚Äôve worked on.

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è _Vesuvius_
[Vesuvius](https://github.com/L1Ryx/Vesuvius) is a surreal metroidvania where the player uncovers the secrets of a snowy Mt. Vesuvius and its mysterious cult.

Being more of a long-term project, [a demo](https://l1ryx.itch.io/vesuvius) is currently available, showcasing the game's core mechanics, including exploration, melee combat, and sound implementation. Audio is implemented dynamically using Wwise, ensuring immersive and reactive soundscapes that adapt to player actions and environmental events.

### ü¶ñ _Epoch Warriors_
[Epoch Warriors](https://github.com/dgardner01/epochwarriors) is a fast-paced card-based fighting game between two dinosaurs.
