## üëã Hello there!
I'm Shawn, a gameplay programmer and technical sound designer at [Serious Point Games](https://www.seriouspointgames.com/). At the moment, I‚Äôm working on our upcoming PC/VR title, *The Ski Lodge Murder*. 

I also co-founded the [Hopkins Game Dev Society](https://www.hopkinsgamedevsociety.com/), where we empower Johns Hopkins University students to create games by providing formal mentorship and hosting career-building events.

I'm comfortable with:
- Game Engines: Unity, Unreal
- Languages: C++, C#, C, Javascript (React, TypeScript), Java, GLSL, HLSL, Python
- Audio Middleware: Wwise, FMOD

When I‚Äôm not working on professional projects, I like building personal games and implementing cool game design ideas (glorified shower thoughts). This page serves as a brief introduction to my work and a showcase of some of the more recent personal projects I‚Äôve worked on.

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è _Vesuvius_
[Vesuvius](https://github.com/L1Ryx/Vesuvius) is a surreal metroidvania where the player uncovers the secrets of a snowy Mt. Vesuvius and its mysterious cult.  

Being more of a **long-term project**, [a playable demo](https://l1ryx.itch.io/vesuvius) is currently available, showcasing the game's core mechanics, including exploration, melee combat, and sound implementation. Audio is implemented dynamically using **Wwise**, ensuring immersive and reactive soundscapes that adapt to player actions and environmental events. Learn more in this [audio implementation demo](https://play.reelcrafter.com/aG3LGNytSIGzhQa5dXnDBA).

### ü¶ñ _Epoch Warriors_
[Epoch Warriors](https://github.com/dgardner01/epochwarriors) is a fast-paced card-based fighting game between two dinosaurs.  

The game's main draw is how it combines turn-based strategy and relentless action, which is done through the player creating satisfying combos without having to memorize complex inputs. Apart from contributing to gameplay programming, I also worked on audio programming **without relying on middleware** to better suit a WebGL build. The game is playable [here](https://freakflaggames.itch.io/epoch-warriors).

### ü™µ _Adam's Room_
[Adam's Room](https://github.com/L1Ryx/Adams-Room) is a survival game set in a single forest clearing with rogue-like elements. Your only goal is to collect logs scattered around the map to keep the fire in the center burning.  

Each playthrough offers unique combinations of merchant items and hazardous events. Random events, such as wildfires or heavy winds, keep the player on edge, with the events becoming more weird and unsettling as the night goes on. A playable demo is still in the works, but here is a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hSjNKDpxdY).
