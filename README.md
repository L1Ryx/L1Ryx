## 👋 Hello there!
I'm Shawn Guo, a gameplay programmer and technical sound designer at [Serious Point Games](https://www.seriouspointgames.com/). At the moment, I’m working on our upcoming PC/VR title, *The Ski Lodge Murder*. 

I also co-founded the [Hopkins Game Dev Society](https://www.hopkinsgamedevsociety.com/), where we empower Johns Hopkins University students to create games by providing formal mentorship and hosting career-building events.

I'm comfortable with:
- Game Engines: Unity, Unreal
- Languages: C++, C#, C, Javascript (React, TypeScript), Java, GLSL, HLSL, Python
- Audio Middleware: Wwise, FMOD

When I’m not working on professional projects, I like building personal games and implementing cool game design ideas (glorified shower thoughts). This page serves as a brief introduction to my work and a showcase of some of the more recent personal projects I’ve worked on.
