## 👋 Hello there!
I'm Shawn Guo, a gameplay programmer and technical sound designer at Serious Point Games. At the moment, I’m working on our upcoming PC/VR title, *The Ski Lodge Murder*. My role involves creating engaging gameplay mechanics and immersive audio experiences that bring the project to life. 

I'm comfortable with:
- Game Engines: Unity, Unreal
- Languages: C++, C#, C, Javascript (React, TypeScript), Java, GLSL, HLSL, Python
- Audio Middleware: Wwise, FMOD

When I’m not working on professional projects, I like building personal games and implementing cool game design ideas (glorified shower thoughts). This page serves as a brief introduction to my work and a showcase of some of the more personal projects I’ve worked on.
