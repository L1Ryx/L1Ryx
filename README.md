# Hello there!
I'm Shawn Guo, a gameplay programmer and technical sound designer at Serious Point Games, where I’m currently working on our upcoming PC/VR title, *The Ski Lodge Murder*. My role involves creating engaging gameplay mechanics and immersive audio experiences that bring the project to life. 

When I’m not working on professional projects, I enjoy building personal games and implementing cool game design ideas (glorified shower thoughts). This page serves as a brief introduction to my work and a showcase of some of the projects I’ve worked on.
