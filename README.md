I've worked as a Software Engineering Intern on the _Call of Duty_ franchise at [Activision/Raven Software](https://www.ravensoftware.com/our-games) and as a Gameplay Programmer & Tech Sound Designer at [Serious Point Games](https://www.seriouspointgames.com/) for their upcoming title, _The Ski Lodge Murder_. 

I also co-founded the [Hopkins Game Dev Society](https://www.hopkinsgamedevsociety.com/), where we empower Johns Hopkins University students to create games by providing formal mentorship and hosting career-building events.

When I’m not working on professional projects, I like building smaller games and implementing cool game design ideas (glorified shower thoughts). This page is a brief introduction to my work and a showcase of some of the more recent personal projects I’ve worked on.

### 🔭 _Ducks Afar_

_Ducks Afar_ is a short, story-driven puzzle game about tracking down your ducks across a distant solar system. As a planetary field researcher, you recover lost ducks by preparing their favorite meals using packs of HARDWORMS, which are highly magnetic resources that cannot be split or combined by hand. To reach the exact amounts each duck demands, you must operate ancient machines embedded in the environment, turning simple arithmetic transformations into physical, world-driven puzzles.

- [Source Code](https://github.com/L1Ryx/Ducks-Afar)

The project focuses on building a highly polished vertical slice, with particular attention to gameplay clarity, UI and audio juicing, and clean, extensible architecture. On the engineering side, the game emphasizes strong state management through a facade-style game context and structured level sequencing using ScriptableObject-based narrative and gameplay beats. A playable demo of a single level is currently available.

### ❄️ _Vesuvius_
[_Vesuvius_](https://vesuviusgame.com) is a surreal metroidvania where the player uncovers the secrets of a snowy Mt. Vesuvius and its mysterious cult. Its core mechanic centers on shifting between two parallel dimensions to solve puzzles, engagei n combat, and slowly uncover "the other side."

Being more of a **long-term project**, a ~30-minute playable demo is currently available, showcasing the game's core mechanics, including exploration, melee combat, and sound implementation. Audio is implemented dynamically using **Wwise**, ensuring immersive and reactive soundscapes that adapt to player actions and environmental events.

*Vesuvius* is a collaborative project with [Brett Wolfinger](https://github.com/BrettWolfinger), and together we make up the indie studio Snow Day Games.

### 🦖 _Epoch Warriors_
[Epoch Warriors](https://github.com/dgardner01/epochwarriors) is a fast-paced card-based fighting game between two dinosaurs.  

The game's main draw is how it combines turn-based strategy and relentless action, which is done through the player creating satisfying combos without having to memorize complex inputs. Apart from contributing to gameplay programming, I also worked on audio programming **without relying on middleware** to better suit a WebGL build. The game is playable [here](https://freakflaggames.itch.io/epoch-warriors).

### 🤖 _Deja You_
[_Deja You_](https://johnnieshen.itch.io/deja-you) is a time-loop puzzle platformer where every rewind spawns a new Lifetime: a ghost of your past actions that continues performing what you did before. The twist is that you have a limited "Time Budget", and every second you spend eats into it. 

Across 15 levels inspired by Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, you’ll climb from survival to self-actualization not just by mastering movement, but by coordinating with your past selves. Use multiple Lifetimes to press switches, set up chain reactions, and help future-you reach the exit before the clock runs out.

Base version built in 4 days for the 2025 GMTK Game Jam by members of the Hopkins Game Development Society, where I co-led this project.

### ♥️ _Love Language_
[_Love Language_](https://hopkins-game-dev-society.itch.io/love-language) begins as a wholesome visual novel about finally putting yourself out there on a café date, but things quickly unravel as your dating anxiety twists the world into unsettling minigames. What starts as simple conversation soon fractures into frantic challenges, distorted mechanics, and rising tension as you try to keep the date from falling apart.

Built in 6 days for the 2025 Scream Jam by members of the Hopkins Game Development Society, where I co-produced this project, as well as lead engineering and VFX/Audio implementation.

### 🪵 _Adam's Room_
[Adam's Room](https://github.com/L1Ryx/Adams-Room) is a survival game set in a single forest clearing with rogue-like elements. Your only goal is to collect logs scattered around the map to keep the fire in the center burning.  

Each playthrough offers unique combinations of merchant items and hazardous events. Random events, such as wildfires or heavy winds, keep the player on edge, with the events becoming more weird and unsettling as the night goes on. A playable demo is still in the works, but here is a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hSjNKDpxdY).
